  **StockSavvy Analytics**

An interactive Streamlit app for stock market analysis using machine learning, developed as part of Programming for Finance under the guidance of Dr.Usama Arshad.
App Overview
StockSavvy Analytics is a web-based application that enables users to analyze stock market data through a comprehensive machine learning pipeline. It supports both custom datasets (e.g., CSV files with columns like Date, Netsol_price, Mughal_price, Kohat_price) and live data from Yahoo Finance. With a sleek pastel-themed UI (coral and mint colors), the app guides users through data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
